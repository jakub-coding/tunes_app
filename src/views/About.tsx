                Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don&lsquo;t be afraid. Don&lsquo;t worry, he&lsquo;ll be all
                right. What
                happened? Rest easy, son, you&lsquo;ve had a busy day. You&lsquo;re fortunate you&lsquo;re still in one
                piece. Ben? Ben
                Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
                Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he&lsquo;s searching for his former
                master...I&lsquo;ve never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He
                claims
                to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he&lsquo;s talking
                about?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
                All right, kid. But you&lsquo;d better be right about this. All right. What&lsquo;s your plan? Uh...Threepio, hand
                me those binders there will you? Okay. Now, I&lsquo;m going to put these on you. Okay. Han, you put these on.
                Don&lsquo;t worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but,
                ah...what should Artoo and I do if we&lsquo;re discovered here? Lock the door! And hope they don&lsquo;t have
                blasters. That isn&lsquo;t very reassuring.
